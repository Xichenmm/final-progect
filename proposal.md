# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rremember Me

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A simply memory game, give you a platform and you can filp different cards untill you get the same two patterns. Challenging for your memory. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This game can train your memory in some degree. We need to install pygame in our program to be able to run the whole program, this program allow you to pick on different cards. If you pick on different pattern, the game will et you to try again. The feature for this game is good for any age, any time and any where. We need to write out different color and shape for each card. If you finished the whole game, you will see something.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will combine 1051's final with 2521. The idea and the logitcal will relate to 1051, and I need to use different language to be able to finish 2521's final.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Jingyan Deng is my partner, tuj87723@temple.edu. Her TA's name is Tamara Katic.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Good outcome is we will finfish our code and be able to run it out.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We make sure the player can understand how to play this game and be able to make his choice. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will try to give player a nice ending when they finish the game, to get a "Congraducation" or dynamic firework. The player can try harder lelvel's game when they pass.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We need to learn how to install pygame in the program and learn how to use python to filp the card and filp back. Jingyan will need to make sure the program run's well, I will focous on how to define different colors and shapes, most part we will disscuss a lot by using our ideas and ourside sources.
